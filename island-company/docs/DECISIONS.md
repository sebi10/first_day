# Decisions log: where this build departs from the spec, and why

Spec: *Island Company — Game Spec Sheet* (Sep 23, 2026). The brief changed to "free, just for three friends, not on the App Store, snappy". Each deviation below says what changed, why, and how to undo it.

## Platform

| Spec | Built | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unity 6 URP, iOS/Android store builds | Installable web app (PWA): Preact + TypeScript + Vite | With no App Store, iOS sideloading a Unity build needs a Mac, Xcode, and either $99/yr or a free profile that expires every 7 days. A PWA installs from Safari/Chrome for $0, updates instantly, and also runs on computers. |
| Firebase Auth (phone/Apple/Google) | Anonymous auth + island code + per-seat code | Zero-friction for 3 friends. Seat codes link phone ↔ computer. To upgrade later, add Google sign-in and keep the same `seatHas` check. |
| Cloud Functions resolve the week | Any client resolves inside a Firestore transaction | Cloud Functions need the paid Blaze plan. Resolution is a pure deterministic reducer, so whichever phone sees the deadline first resolves it, and the week-number check makes it idempotent. Trade-off: a phone with a wrong clock could resolve slightly early. That's acceptable among friends. |
| Signed state diffs | Plain transactions, trust-the-friends rules | Anti-tamper matters for strangers, not for 3 friends (Chesterton's fence: it existed for a public game). The island code (≈50 bits) is the key, and listing islands is blocked. |
| FCM push | Optional ntfy.sh topic (free, no server) | FCM sending needs a server key and server. ntfy is a free push relay the clients post to directly. |
| 60k-tri 3D island | Painterly low-poly **SVG** island | Same art direction (palette, facets, time of day, weather, zone zoom) at a fraction of the weight: ≈80 kB gzipped first load, not 150 MB. |
| Monetization | None | Built for friends. |

## Rules clarified (the spec contradicted itself)

1. **Airworthiness bands.** The spec says planes fly at ≥60 but also "incident if flown at <40", which can't both hold if <60 is grounded. Built: **≥60 full schedule (4 flights), 40–59 restricted (2 flights, 10% near-miss per flight), <40 AOG.** This matches the spec's own review example ("2 flights lost: airworthiness 55").
2. **Houses** mirror planes: ≥60 rentable, 40–59 rentable with a 25% outage roll (half refund, near-miss), <40 closed, <30 fire risk (15%/week).
3. **Tier 1 has no cargo plane**, yet parts ride cargo flights. Built: at tier 1 each guest flight carries 1 kit in the hold. From tier 2 the cargo plane carries 3 per flight.
4. **Guests need flights:** each passenger flight brings one party (one house-week). Spare flights sell day-tour charters. Tier 3 adds 2 ferry parties per week (the spec's "guest ferry days"), which frees flights for charters.
5. **Deferral risk** is exactly the spec's formula: 10% at tier 1, +10 per tier, +10 per extra week, cap 60%, incident = 3× the order cost + downstream loss. It rolls the week *after* an order is first carried, so the team always gets one week to react. Undecided cards count as deferred by the analyst. Approved-but-undone orders count against their owner.
6. **Missed turns never count toward unlocks.** Autopilot (50%) keeps the island alive, but those weeks don't add B+ weeks or perfect weeks, and they reset the streak. Without this, the paper sim showed a team where *nobody* played still reaching tier 2 by week 4.
7. **Week pacing.** The next deadline is the first 20:00 (creator's tz) at least 12 h after the week opens. Finishing early resolves immediately, and nobody ever gets a 5-minute week.
8. **Repair budgets.** The spec's "approved budget for repairs" is now two sliders (mechanic and electrician). Jobs under the budget auto-approve when the week opens, so nobody waits on the analyst for a $120 breaker trace. Bigger jobs arrive as swipe cards.
9. **Insurance tiers** (none / standard / premium) are real: weekly premium vs share of incident cost covered.
10. **First week is a guaranteed B or better** (spec), and nothing can fail in week 0.

## Owner direction added during the build (Sep 26)

- **Real trade knowledge is the gate between roles, not in-game levels.** The three players really are an A&P mechanic, an electrician and an FP&A analyst. Every puzzle models the real procedure.
  - Tiers 0–2 teach: sequence numbers, terminal labels, fair-value markers, run-rate guides.
  - From tier 3 that scaffolding is gone. A tradesperson solves it from knowledge, and an outsider mostly guesses.
  - Each puzzle model has a test asserting that no answer-revealing hint survives at tier 3+.
- **Lend a hand replaces the spec's cover rule** (the spec allowed covering after 2 missed turns, at double cost).
  - Anyone may try another trade's ready job once a week (mentors twice), at normal cost, without their own trade's tools.
  - Under 40% is a botch: the asset takes −6 and the job stays open for its owner.
  - Nobody is ever fully gridlocked, and specialisation still matters.
- **Integral but not gridlocked:**
  - Parallel turns.
  - Auto-approve budgets for small jobs.
  - Autopilot at 50% for missed days.
  - A 12-hour minimum week.
  - Lend a hand.

## Additions (beyond MVP scope)

- **Six more real-life puzzles** (15 total): weight and balance, safety wire, multimeter diagnosis, conduit bending, bank reconciliation, three-way match. Every role now has five puzzle types, each modelled on the actual procedure.
- **All 5 island tiers** are data-driven in `src/sim/data.ts` (spec MVP was tiers 1–2). Tiers 3–5 add storms, the ferry, the generator, a floatplane, villas, a lodge, and night flights.
- **Pass-and-play** on one device, plus **move to online** with progress intact.
- **Desktop layout** (two columns), keyboard approvals (← defer, → approve, ↑ counter), Esc to close.
- **Story cards** every 3-week B+ streak (6 at launch).
- **Analyst money hunts:** each week's close alternates between variance find and bank reconciliation, plus a three-way match whenever last week's spend was ≥ $500. Each recovers a hidden leak, so an absent analyst costs real money.

## Balance (paper sim, `npm run balance`): 26 weeks × 30 seeds, medians

Retuned after the balance and systems critiques (Sep 26).

| Team | Tier at wk 26 | Wk → T2 / T3 / T4 / T5 | % weeks B+ | Min cash | Weeks < $0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All good | 5 | 4 / 7 / 15 / 20 | 100% | $6,468 | 0 |
| All average (3 jobs/turn, 10% missed turns) | 5 | 5 / 9 / 15 / 20 | 95% | $6,335 | 0 |
| **Three friends** (skill drops with tier, absences in streaks) | 5 | 5 / 9 / 15 / 20 | 89% | $3,089 | 0 |
| Naive analyst (approves everything, never prices) | 3 | 4 / 13 / — / — | 100% | $5,973 | 0 |
| Any role absent / any solo player | 1 | — | 34–100% | down to −$135k | up to 447 of 780 |

What changed and why:

- **Death spiral fixed.** Approved jobs waiting for a part no longer roll deferral incidents. Before, a grounded twin at tier 1 meant parts could never land and a 60% incident every week, forever.
- **Pacing.**
  - Tier 3 now needs $18k (was $25k).
  - Tier 4 needs 15 weeks (was 12).
  - Tier 5 needs 20 weeks and $60k (was 24 weeks and $100k).
  - Fixed costs at tier 4 / 5 are $7,000 / $9,500 (were $5,500 / $7,500).
  - Every tier now lasts long enough to matter: roughly 4 / 5 / 6 / 5 weeks, then the endgame.
- **Difficulty climbs with the island.**
  - Ops order tier = catalog tier + ⌊island tier / 2⌋.
  - The analyst's tier gains a step every 20 weeks (was 10).
  - Expert tiers (3+, no teaching aids) arrive from about week 5–9.
- **Approvals matter again.** Auto-approve is petty cash only: parts-free, tier ≤2, ≤$150 per tier, capped at one week's fixed cost. Bigger work always comes to the analyst as a card.
- **Insurance is a real call.**
  - Storms (tier 3+) cause claims in 60% of storm weeks: $1,500 plus $1,000 per tier above 2.
  - Wind claims can happen from tier 2.
  - Premiums are $150 / $320.
- **Mastery pays.**
  - A perfect job holds: the asset skips next week's decay.
  - The forecast bonus is up to $1,400 × tier factor.
- **Puzzle time budgets:** tier difficulty is never a race. Invoice gets about 24 s per card at every tier; reconcile gets 50 + 21 × tier; teardown gets 60 + 22 × tier.
- **Critical assets always get a job:**
  - An asset under 45 health with nothing open on it jumps the queue, even past the cap (8).
  - Before, a clogged queue let the grid rot to 5.

Spec phase-0 exit tests, automated in `tests/engine.test.ts`:

- **No role can win alone.** Pass: every solo team stays at tier 1.
- **No week ends with cash < 0 under sensible play.** Pass: minimum $3,089, including the three-friends team.
- **Every unlock is reachable within 26 weeks.** Pass: tier 5 by week 20.

**Goodhart warning.** The board grade weights revenue at 40%, so an analyst can inflate it by pricing up. The rate cap (2× base) limits that, occupancy falls off a logistic curve, and empty houses cost the electrician's "houses booked" MVP line. If players start gaming the grade, lower the revenue weight in `resolveWeek`, or grade revenue *per rentable house* instead.

## Open questions for the three of you

- **Deadline hour:** 20:00 creator time. If the three of you span time zones, change `resolveHour` in `createIsland`.
- **Difficulty:** if weeks feel too easy by tier 3, raise `ECON.decay` from 5 to 6. That is the single biggest knob.
- **Trust model:** anyone with the island code can play an open seat. That's fine for friends. Don't post the code publicly.

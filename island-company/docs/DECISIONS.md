# Decisions log: where this build departs from the spec, and why

Spec: *Island Company — Game Spec Sheet* (Sep 23, 2026). The brief changed to "free, just for three friends, not on the App Store, snappy". Each deviation below says what changed, why, and how to undo it.

## Platform

| Spec | Built | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unity 6 URP, iOS/Android store builds | Installable web app (PWA): Preact + TypeScript + Vite | With no App Store, iOS sideloading a Unity build needs a Mac, Xcode, and either $99/yr or a free profile that expires every 7 days. A PWA installs from Safari/Chrome for $0, updates instantly, and also runs on computers. |
| Firebase Auth (phone/Apple/Google) | Anonymous auth + island code + per-seat code | Zero-friction for 3 friends. Seat codes link phone ↔ computer. To upgrade later, add Google sign-in and keep the same `seatHas` check. |
| Cloud Functions resolve the week | Any client resolves inside a Firestore transaction | Cloud Functions need the paid Blaze plan. Resolution is a pure deterministic reducer, so whichever phone sees the deadline first resolves it, and the week-number check makes it idempotent. Trade-off: a phone with a wrong clock could resolve slightly early. That's acceptable among friends. |
| Signed state diffs | Plain transactions, trust-the-friends rules | Anti-tamper matters for strangers, not for 3 friends (Chesterton's fence: it existed for a public game). The island code (≈50 bits) is the key, and listing islands is blocked. |
| FCM push | Optional ntfy.sh topic (free, no server) | FCM sending needs a server key and server. ntfy is a free push relay the clients post to directly. |
| 60k-tri 3D island | Painterly low-poly **SVG** island | Same art direction (palette, facets, time of day, weather, zone zoom) at a fraction of the weight: ≈80 kB gzipped first load, not 150 MB. |
| Monetization | None | Built for friends. |

## Rules clarified (the spec contradicted itself)

1. **Airworthiness bands.** The spec says planes fly at ≥60 but also "incident if flown at <40", which can't both hold if <60 is grounded. Built: **≥60 full schedule (4 flights), 40–59 restricted (2 flights, 10% near-miss per flight), <40 AOG.** This matches the spec's own review example ("2 flights lost: airworthiness 55").
2. **Houses** mirror planes: ≥60 rentable, 40–59 rentable with a 25% outage roll (half refund, near-miss), <40 closed, <30 fire risk (15%/week).
3. **Tier 1 has no cargo plane**, yet parts ride cargo flights. Built: at tier 1 each guest flight carries 1 kit in the hold. From tier 2 the cargo plane carries 3 per flight.
4. **Guests need flights:** each passenger flight brings one party (one house-week). Spare flights sell day-tour charters. Tier 3 adds 2 ferry parties per week (the spec's "guest ferry days"), which frees flights for charters.
5. **Deferral risk** is exactly the spec's formula: 10% at tier 1, +10 per tier, +10 per extra week, cap 60%, incident = 3× the order cost + downstream loss. It rolls the week *after* an order is first carried, so the team always gets one week to react. Undecided cards count as deferred by the analyst. Approved-but-undone orders count against their owner.
6. **Missed turns never count toward unlocks.** Autopilot (50%) keeps the island alive, but those weeks don't add B+ weeks or perfect weeks, and they reset the streak. Without this, the paper sim showed a team where *nobody* played still reaching tier 2 by week 4.
7. **Week pacing.** The next deadline is the first 20:00 (creator's tz) at least 12 h after the week opens. Finishing early resolves immediately, and nobody ever gets a 5-minute week.
8. **Repair budgets.** The spec's "approved budget for repairs" is now two sliders (mechanic and electrician). Jobs under the budget auto-approve when the week opens, so nobody waits on the analyst for a $120 breaker trace. Bigger jobs arrive as swipe cards.
9. **Insurance tiers** (none / standard / premium) are real: weekly premium vs share of incident cost covered.
10. **First week is a guaranteed B or better** (spec), and nothing can fail in week 0.

## Owner direction added during the build (Sep 26)

- **Real trade knowledge is the gate between roles, not in-game levels.** The three players really are an A&P mechanic, an electrician and an FP&A analyst. Every puzzle models the real procedure.
  - Tiers 0–2 teach: sequence numbers, terminal labels, fair-value markers, run-rate guides.
  - From tier 3 that scaffolding is gone. A tradesperson solves it from knowledge, and an outsider mostly guesses.
  - Each puzzle model has a test asserting that no answer-revealing hint survives at tier 3+.
- **Lend a hand replaces the spec's cover rule** (the spec allowed covering after 2 missed turns, at double cost).
  - Anyone may try another trade's ready job once a week (mentors twice), at normal cost, without their own trade's tools.
  - Under 40% is a botch: the asset takes −6 and the job stays open for its owner.
  - Nobody is ever fully gridlocked, and specialisation still matters.
- **Integral but not gridlocked:**
  - Parallel turns.
  - Auto-approve budgets for small jobs.
  - Autopilot at 50% for missed days.
  - A 12-hour minimum week.
  - Lend a hand.

## Additions (beyond MVP scope)

- **Six more real-life puzzles** (15 total): weight and balance, safety wire, multimeter diagnosis, conduit bending, bank reconciliation, three-way match. Every role now has five puzzle types, each modelled on the actual procedure.
- **All 5 island tiers** are data-driven in `src/sim/data.ts` (spec MVP was tiers 1–2). Tiers 3–5 add storms, the ferry, the generator, a floatplane, villas, a lodge, and night flights.
- **Pass-and-play** on one device, plus **move to online** with progress intact.
- **Desktop layout** (two columns), keyboard approvals (← defer, → approve, ↑ counter), Esc to close.
- **Story cards** every 3-week B+ streak (6 at launch).
- **Analyst money hunts:** each week's close alternates between variance find and bank reconciliation, plus a three-way match whenever last week's spend was ≥ $500. Each recovers a hidden leak, so an absent analyst costs real money.

## Balance (paper sim, `npm run balance`): 26 weeks × 30 seeds, medians

| Team | Tier at wk 26 | Wk → T2 / T3 / T4 / T5 | % weeks B+ | Min cash | Weeks < $0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All good | 5 | 4 / 11 / 12 / 24 | 99% | $5,751 | 0 |
| All average (3 jobs/turn, 10% missed turns) | 5 | 5 / 12 / 13 / 24 | 94% | $5,101 | 0 |
| Naive analyst (approves everything, never prices) | 3 | 4 / 19 / — / — | 99% | $4,169 | 0 |
| Mechanic absent | 1 | — | 99%* | $5,822 | 0 |
| Analyst absent | 1 | — | 77% | −$138,352 | 136 of 780 |
| Any solo player | 1 | — | 32–83% | −$17k to −$171k | 70–466 |

\* High grades, but autopilot weeks don't count, so no progress.

Spec phase-0 exit tests, now automated in `tests/engine.test.ts`:
- No role can win alone. Pass: every solo team stays at tier 1.
- No week ends with cash < 0 under sensible play. Pass: min $5,101.
- Every unlock is reachable within 26 weeks. Pass: tier 5 by week 24.

**Goodhart warning.** The board grade weights revenue at 40%, so an analyst can inflate it by pricing up. The rate cap (2× base) limits that, occupancy falls off a logistic curve, and empty houses cost the electrician's "houses booked" MVP line. If players start gaming the grade, lower the revenue weight in `resolveWeek`, or grade revenue *per rentable house* instead.

## Open questions for the three of you

- **Deadline hour:** 20:00 creator time. If the three of you span time zones, change `resolveHour` in `createIsland`.
- **Difficulty:** if weeks feel too easy by tier 3, raise `ECON.decay` from 5 to 6. That is the single biggest knob.
- **Trust model:** anyone with the island code can play an open seat. That's fine for friends. Don't post the code publicly.
